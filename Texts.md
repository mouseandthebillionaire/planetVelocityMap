## Andre, Carl

![Carl Andre - Sculptures](https://cdn.britannica.com/73/181273-050-6363B868/exhibition-DIA-Beacon-Carl-Andre-NY-work-March-2015.jpg)

*"My idea of a iece of sculpture is a road [...] That is, a road doesn't reveal itself at any particular point or from any particular point. Roads appear and disappear .... We don't have a single point of view for a road at all, except a moving one, moving along it."* - quoted from Solnit's *Wanderlust* who adds that "Andre's minimal sculptures, like Chinese scrolls, reveal themselves over time in response to the movement of the looker." (269)

## Han, B. _The Disappearance of Rituals_, 2020

_"Rituals are processes of embodiment and bodily performances."_ (11)

_"In a culture of raging narcissism, playfulness disappears, and life loses its cheerfulness and exuberance. The culture retreats from that holy sphere of play. The compulsions of work and performance intensify the profanation of life. The holy seriousness of play gives way to the profane seriousness of work."_ (23)

Much of this work deals with narcissism versus community and I'm not sure how much of that I want to talk about that. But this quote is definitely interesting and could be used. I wonder how it would be possible to talk about community within a soundwalk experience, in particular. Soundwalks in general are fairly individualistic (in that you've got headphones on, you are by yourself). I suppose it could be possible with the Echoes platform for people to do a soundwalk simultaneously, but even the organization angle makes that feel difficult (convincing multiple people to do a weird esoteric activity with you on an otherwise-pleasant afternoon...)

The other option, of course, is to talk about community within an individual experience. This idea that we are batting around right now about a particular block in Manhattan could easily be about community. Thinking about the history of that space, the people who have lived there over the decades. The people that live there now. There's a lot there in which you can point to community; point to history; point to culture; point to a larger world outside of your headphones.

_"Magic and enchantment – the true sources of art – disappear from culture, to be replaced by discourse."_ (24)

TODO: Reflect on Chapter 7

_"Along the path towards work, thinking gradually distances itself from its origin in play."_ (79)

 Chapter 9, generally talks about the beginnings of philosophy and how they used ritual games and riddle solving. He discusses how that has changed from a playful battle of wits to a workly thinking through the enlightenment, which is only exacerbated by the age of 'dataism.' Han also discusses that for Kant:

_"In the face of beauty, the cognitive faculties, namely imagination and understanding, are in play mode. The subject likes what is beautiful; the beautiful creates a feeling of pleasure by triggering a harmonious interplay of the cognitive faculties. The beautiful does not buy itself produce knowledge, but it entertains the cognitive mechanisms and, by doing so, promotes the production of knowledge."_ (80)

This is a pretty great section for discussing 'thinking' as a playful activity. I don't know how readily that feeds into contemplation (or if we're getting into sticky territory a la Deweyian reflection) but could be useful and/or at least a fun rabbit-hole to spend some time in.

## Han, B. *Non-things*, 2022

Note: Picked this one up because I thought it would be especially good for the 'plaything' section of the thesis. Started reading it while working on the [Eikon](https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/eikon) project for Whaaat!? 2025, and used [a collection of passages](https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/eikon/blob/main/Process/Journal.md#102725--koans) from the book as texts for that project.

*"We are now in the habit of perceiving reality in terms of attraction and surprise. As information hunters, we are becoming blind to still, inconspicuous things, to what is common, the incidental, and the customary – the things that do not attract us, but ground us in being."* (preface ix)

A good distinction between the flash of digital technologies and the contemplative nature of certain objects. The whole book, in fact, is filled with this distinction.

*"Lingering is another time, consuming practice. Perception that latches onto information does not have a lasting and slow gaze. Information makes us shortsighted and short of breath. It is not possible to linger on information lingering on things in contemplation, intentionless seeing, which would be a formula for happiness, gives way to the hunt for information. Today, we pursue information without gaining knowledge. We take notice of everything without gaining any insight. We travel across the world without having an experience. We communicate incessantly without participating in a community. We collect vast quantities of data without following up on our recollections. We accumulate 'friends' and 'followers' without meeting an other."* (7)

Much of this was used as the texts for Eikon. Some really snappy bold statements in here that lent themselves well to that. A note that I haven't included the numerous german translations from the original text.

*"The emancipatory effects of digitalization promise a form of life that resembles play."* (8-9)

Probably not of use to me due to its damning nature, but Han's notion of *phono sapiens* is an interesting one. He plots a trajectory from *homo faber* (Hegel: Spirit is work. Spirit is hand), to the idea of *homo ludens*, to the current stage *phono sapiens,* and mourns the loss. Not sure if I can somehow incorparate this. Is there something to be said for the desire to use *other* forms of play than the phone?

*"Smart phones have established themselves as the devotional objects of the neoliberal regime. As apparatus that served the purpose of submission, they resemble the rosary, which is just as mobile and handy. The 'like' is the digital amen."* (24)

Ha! What a statement. An argument could be made based on this this that 'contemplative' objects are already present in people's lives, but that the focus of that contemplation is hollow? Likewise, the next page begins an argument that the phone is not a *transitional object* as is often argued. Truly transitional objects, Han argues, "build a bridge to reality, to the other, to what escapes the fantasy of omnipotence." (26) Additionally, these are irreplaceable objects. When a child loses their blankie, it cannot be easily replaced. But when we lose a phone, we simply mourn the sunk cost and buy another:

*"the child imbues the transitional object with symbolic value. The object becomes the vessel in which the child's dreams are concentrated. The smart phone, by contrast, floods us with stimuli and represses our imagination."* (27)

Additionally:

*"Unlike the transitional object, the smart phone is hard; it is not a digital teddy bear. Rather, it is a narcissistic, autistic object through which we feel, most of all, ourselves. It thus also destroys empathy. We use the smart phone to retreat into a narcissistic sphere in which we are protected against the imponderable pertaining to the other. […] We communicate so compulsively so excessively, because we are lonely and empty. But hypercommunication is not fulfilling. Because it lacks the presence of the other, it only deepen the loneliness."* (28)


## Han, B. _Vita Contemplativa_, 2023

_"We are losing a sense for the kind of inactivity that is not an incapability, not a refusal, not just the absence of activity but a capacity in itself."_ (1)

_"'Leisure time' lacks both intensity of life and contemplation. It is a time that we kill so as not to get bored. It is not free, living time; it is dead time."_ (2)

_"We owe true happiness to the useless and purposeless, to what is intentionally convoluted, what is unproductive, indirect, exuberant, superfluous, to beautiful forms and gestures that have no use and serve no purpose."_ (5)

_"Information is the active form of language. Poetry, by contrast, suspense, language as information. In poetry, language enters the mood of contemplation. It becomes inactive."_ (19)

## Fullerton, T. & Farber, M. _The Well-Read Game_, 2025

_"When we play deeply, we take on an aesthetic stance and we are free to explore our own thoughts and feelings about experiences in games."_ (53)

There is a lot here in terms of language and touchpoints. Using Oliveras' deep listening as a foundation for 'deep play' is a good start (Fullerton & Farber point to Lantz's _Beauty of Games_ for that reference). Additionally, beyond F&F's 'well-played' we also have 'anticipatory play' (Upton), 'noninteractive play' (Upton), 'interpretive play' (Upton), and Fullerton's concept of the 'interlude mechanic.' The interlude mechanic in particular might be of interest for the thesis writing, especially in the Playtime section. It helps to cement and/or back the idea of creating breathing/reflective space into the play experience. In general, a more scholarly version of Raven Wu's _[In Praise of Negative Space in Video Game Storytelling](https://intothespine.com/2021/03/27/in-praise-of-negative-space-in-video-game-storytelling/)_ article that I liked so muc. Additionally, I haven't read it yet, but in trying to re-find Wu's article I found amr al-aaser's _[The Art of Nothing: A Look at Negative Space within Videogames](https://siegarettes.medium.com/the-art-of-nothing-a-look-at-negative-space-within-videogames-b92cf950cb73)_ which seems to argues the same thing.

## Ghost of Tsushima, 2020

There is an interesting interlude in *Ghost of Tsushima* where the player has the opportunity to create a Haiku. There is pleasant music. The action slows down for a minute as Jin Sakai kneels on a mat in front of a lake. There are branching choices (not dissimilar to my own [Kuhai](https://mouseandthebillionaire.com/kuhai/)) that highlight a view of nature during the choice. You move the camera around to pick the phrase and corresponding natural element. It feels like an idea that could have reflective/contemplative implications, but it is also done in such a transactional way (so much so that "completing" the haiku gets you a special headband as a reward). A quick Google search tells me that there are 19 of these locations, and completing them all gets you the [Body, Mind, and Spirit Trophy](https://www.polygon.com/ghost-of-tsushima-guide/21349587/all-haiku-locations-headbands/)

It feels hollow. It is trading on a reflective mode of art for some other reason. Cultural authenticity? Reference? I'm not sure. But how could this be done in a more successful way (and, as always, would the player even engage with it if it was...?)

## Kandinsky, W. _Concerning the Spiritual in Art_, 1912

_"emotional states clothed in natural forms (which we might referred to as _Stimmung_: mood, town or pitch"_ (15)

Not a great quote here, but the idea of 'Stimmung' I find interesting. Could possibly use this as a definition/word/concept throughout, but at the very least a good reference to a 'third thing' after representation and impressionism. 

_"An era in which art has no representative at the apex of the triangle, and where there is no transfigured bread from which others can draw nourishment, is a period of decline in the spiritual world ... In such mute and blind times, men attach excessive importance to external success; they care only for material goods and hail a technical advance as a great accomplishment."_ (21)

I see a parallel or reference to the game industry focusing on technical achievement above all else. Good graphics, lifelike audio, fast processor speeds become (or have always been?) more important than a glimpse at the truth of the world. 

_"If this how includes the emotions of the artist's soul, and the artwork is capable of radiating his subtler experience, then art will find itself on the threshold of the path to where that lost 'what' can almost certainly be refound, that 'what' which might form the spiritual bread to feed this nascent spiritual awakening. This 'what' will no longer be the material, objective 'what' of the figurative period we are leaving behind, but rather it will be _artistic substance_, the soul of art, which is essential if its body (the 'how') is to lead a full and healthy life, just as it is for an individual or a population.

This what is that which art alone can perceive, which art alone can articulate, through its modes of expression which belong to art and art alone."_ (23-24)

A bold statement. I don't know if I will feel comfortable using this anywhere in regards to play/games (let alone my own work!), but it is well to be reminded that Kandisnky at least saw the potential of art in the world.

_"This mutual comparison among artistic disciplines will only result in success and triumph if what they learn from one another is not external but based on underlying inner principles. That is to say, one art form must first learn from another how to exploit its resources, and then learn how to apply its own media in a way that is _essentially the same_, but guided by the principle that is _unique_ to each discipline alone. In learning this the artist must not forget that every medium has its own appropriate mode of application which awaits discovery."_ (41)

_"Eventually we come to a point where the distinct strengths of different arts coalesce, until which time we see the emergence of a new art, a synthesized art of which we have experienced but a taste: a truly emphasis monumental art."_ (42)

41 and 40 to do a good job here arguing not only that we can learn from other art forms and apply them to the study at hand (namely games/play), but also 42 in particular points to an argument that games might _be_ that emergent new art that synthesizes all other art forms into a truly monumental art. A bold statement, perhaps, but something that could be used in the study.

## Nguyen, C. *Games: Agency as Art*, 2020

Nguyen's argument that _agency_ is one of the core aesthetics of games fits nicely in my chapter on Player. I had been thinking about performance as the key thing here, but maybe the agency within that performance is more important. Additionally on page 19, he speaks about the artificiality of games, which could work with the chapter on playspace:

*"They can function as a refuge from the inhospitality of ordinary life [..] we sculpt for ourselves exactly the kind of practical activity we wish to engage in. We pick the goals, abilities, and the world."* (19)

*Self-effacing ends turn out to be fairly common. Several different yoga teachers I've had have said that yoga asks us to focus on physical movement, but achieving flexibility and physical fitness isn't the point. Concentrating on the physical goals is just a way to sneak up on certain mental and spiritual effects that are too settled to be grasped directly to translate into our terms: yoga has self-effacing ends. You can't achieve relaxation by pursuing it directly. Instead, you must set your mind, a little tasks of balance and posture, from which relaxation will unselfconsciously arise. Similarly, you cannot achieve a calm and blank state of mind by directly aiming at. (Have you ever tried?) Such a state usually arises out of the pursuit of some other goal, like getting to the end of a hike or counting your breath for 10 minutes.* (54)

Self-effacing ends is a good way of thinking about a lot of gameplay scenarios. You play games to relax, or pass the time, or enjoy time with friends. Doesn't it make sense that (like in these examples) you can have a self-efacing end of "mental and spiritual effects." Likening play to yoga is potentially a risky proposition, but I think it's worth thinking thinking about.

Nguyen's conversation about the *maieutic ends* of games where "an end is achieved through a process of coming up with other ends" (62) is really great and could definitely be a helpful way of thinking about this. 

## Solnit, R. _Wanderlust_, 2020

_"because thinking is generally thought of as doing nothing in a production-oriented culture, and doing nothing is hard to do. It's best done by disguising it as doing something and the something closest to doing nothing is walking… It is a bodily labor that produces nothing but thoughts, experiences, arrivals."_ (5)

_"I suspect that the mind, like the feet, works at about three miles an hour"_ (10)

Page 10 also has a long discourse on the ways that the march towards efficiency/technology has actually made our free-time worse by leaving no space for "unstructured travel in between." This idea is coming from so many other people as well, but noting here in case I need even more citations to back up the claim.

_"Walking is a subversive detour, the scenic route through a half-abandoned landscape of ideas and experiences."_ (12)

_"A lone walker is both present and detached from the world around, more than an audience, but less than a participant. Walking assuages or legitimizes this alienation: one is mildly disconnected because one is walking, not because one is incapable of connecting."_ (24)

_"Walking shares with making and working that crucial element of engagement of the body and the mind with the world, of knowing the world through the body and the body through the world."_ (29)

_"Secular walking is often imagined as play, however, competitive and rigourous that play, and uses gear and techniques to make the body more comfortable and more efficient. Pilgrims, on the other hand, often try to make their journey, harder, recalling the origin of the word travel in _travail_."_ (45-46)

*"the subject of gardens was becoming nature itself – a very specific version of nature, nature as a visual spectacle of plants and water and space, a serene thing to be contemplated serenely. Unlike the formal garden and the painting, which had a single ideal point of view from which they could be regarded, the English landscape garden 'asked to be explored, it surprises and unsuspected corners to be discovered on foot'"* (90)

It feels like there's something more here to think about. This idea that a particular art form (in this case the garden) can have a formal and or normal idea and then a more contemplative idea is kind of what I'm going for in this whole study. We can think of movies in the same way perhaps? There are formal/normal movies and then there are movies that are more challenging. More contemplative. Different somehow. Additionally, this concept that a single point of view is in contrast to a deeper explored experienced feels right, especially when we talk about games.

*"Nature was no longer a setting, but the subject. And the walkers in such a garden were no longer being steered toward ready-made reflections on virtue or Virgil; they were free to think their own thoughts as they followed the meandering paths."* (92)

This echos the quote from page 90 as well. This idea that the thing that you are doing can become the item of compilation is something that I'm thinking about a lot here. Right now games are a window or a vehicle with which to tell a story about something or present an idea about something, but could the thing that you're contemplating be play and/our games themselves. Obviously this isn't the exact focus of the study but is something to be thinking about. 

*"There is a subtle state, most dedicated urban walkers know, a sort of basking in solitude – a dark solitude punctuated with encounters as the night sky is punctuated with stars. In the country, one solitude is geographical, and – one is altogether outside society, so solitude has a sensible, geographical explanation, and then there is a kind of communion with the non-human. In the city, one is alone because the world is made up of strangers, and to be a stranger, surrounded by strangers, to walk along silently, bearing one's secrets, and imagining those of the people one passes, is among the starkest of luxuries. This uncharted identity with its illimitable possibilities is one of the distinctive qualities of urban living, a liberatory state, for those should come to emancipate themselves from family and community expectation, to experiment with subculture and identity. It is an observer's state, cool, withdrawn, with senses sharpened, a good state for anybody who needs to reflect or create. In small doses, melancholy, alienation, and introspection are among the life's most refined pleasures."* (186)

A great paragraph here that I might end up using for the NYC walk. Obviously the sentence about reflection is really helpful, but the whole section gives such a nice _feeling_ to the benefits of walking in the city. It perfectly puts words to an experience that I love.
