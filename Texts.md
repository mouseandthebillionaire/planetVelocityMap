## Han, B. "Vita Contemplativa," 2024

_"We are losing a sense for the kind of inactivity that is not an incapability, not a refusal, not just the absence of activity but a capacity in itself."_ (1)

_"'Leisure time' lacks both intensity of life and contemplation. It is a time that we kill so as not to get bored. It is not free, living time; it is dead time."_ (2)

## Kandinsky, W. "Concerning the Spiritual in Art," 1912
