A collection of essays, books, articles, games, music, and artworks referenced during the making/writing of this study

## Han, B. "Vita Contemplativa," 2024

_"We are losing a sense for the kind of inactivity that is not an incapability, not a refusal, not just the absence of activity but a capacity in itself."_ (1)

_"'Leisure time' lacks both intensity of life and contemplation. It is a time that we kill so as not to get bored. It is not free, living time; it is dead time."_ (2)

_"We owe true happiness to the useless and purposeless, to what is intentionally convoluted, what is unproductive, indirect, exuberant, superfluous, to beautiful forms and gestures that have no use and serve no purpose."_ (5)

## Kandinsky, W. "Concerning the Spiritual in Art," 1912

_"emotional states clothed in natural forms (which we might referred to as _Stimmung_: mood, town or pitch"_ (15)

Not a great quote here, but the idea of 'Stimmung' I find interesting. Could possibly use this as a definition/word/concept throughout, but at the very least a good reference to a 'third thing' after representation and impressionism. 

_"An era in which art has no representative at the apex of the triangle, and where there is no transfigured bread from which others can draw nourishment, is a period of decline in the spiritual world ... In such mute and blind times, men attach excessive importance to external success; they care only for material goods and hail a technical advance as a great accomplishment."_ (21)

I see a parallel or reference to the game industry focusing on technical achievement above all else. Good graphics, lifelike audio, fast processor speeds become (or have always been?) more important than a glimpse at the truth of the world. 

_"If this how includes the emotions of the artist's soul, and the artwork is capable of radiating his subtler experience, then art will find itself on the threshold of the path to where that lost 'what' can almost certainly be refound, that 'what' which might form the spiritual bread to feed this nascent spiritual awakening. This 'what' will no longer be the material, objective 'what' of the figurative period we are leaving behind, but rather it will be _artistic substance_, the soul of art, which is essential if its body (the 'how') is to lead a full and healthy life, just as it is for an individual or a population.

This what is that which art alone can perceive, which art alone can articulate, through its modes of expression which belong to art and art alone."_ (23-24)

A bold statement. I don't know if I will feel comfortable using this anywhere in regards to play/games (let alone my own work!), but it is well to be reminded that Kandisnky at least saw the potential of art in the world.

_"This mutual comparison among artistic disciplines will only result in success and triumph if what they learn from one another is not external but based on underlying inner principles. That is to say, one art form must first learn from another how to exploit its resources, and then learn how to apply its own media in a way that is _essentially the same_, but guided by the principle that is _unique_ to each discipline alone. In learning this the artist must not forget that every medium has its own appropriate mode of application which awaits discovery."_ (41)


_"Eventually we come to a point where the distinct strengths of different arts coalesce, until which time we see the emergence of a new art, a synthesized art of which we have experienced but a taste: a truly emphasis monumental art."_ (42)

41 and 40 to do a good job here arguing not only that we can learn from other art forms and apply them to the study at hand (namely games/play), but also 42 in particular points to an argument that games might _be_ that emergent new art that synthesizes all other art forms into a truly monumental art. A bold statement, perhaps, but something that could be used in the study.
