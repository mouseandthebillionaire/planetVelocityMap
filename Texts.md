## Han, B. _The Disappearance of Rituals_, 2020

_"Rituals are processes of embodiment and bodily performances."_ (11)

_"In a culture of raging narcissism, playfulness disappears, and life loses its cheerfulness and exuberance. The culture retreats from that holy sphere of play. The compulsions of work and performance intensify the profanation of life. The holy seriousness of play gives way to the profane seriousness of work."_ (23)

Much of this work deals with narcissism versus community and I'm not sure how much of that I want to talk about that. But this quote is definitely interesting and could be used. I wonder how it would be possible to talk about community within a soundwalk experience, in particular. Soundwalks in general are fairly individualistic (in that you've got headphones on, you are by yourself). I suppose it could be possible with the Echoes platform for people to do a soundwalk simultaneously, but even the organization angle makes that feel difficult (convincing multiple people to do a weird esoteric activity with you on an otherwise-pleasant afternoon...)

The other option, of course, is to talk about community within an individual experience. This idea that we are batting around right now about a particular block in Manhattan could easily be about community. Thinking about the history of that space, the people who have lived there over the decades. The people that live there now. There's a lot there in which you can point to community; point to history; point to culture; point to a larger world outside of your headphones.

_"Magic and enchantment – the true sources of art – disappear from culture, to be replaced by discourse."_ (24)

TODO: Reflect on Chapter 7

_"Along the path towards work, thinking gradually distances itself from its origin in play."_ (79)

 Chapter 9, generally talks about the beginnings of philosophy and how they used ritual games and riddle solving. He discusses how that has changed from a playful battle of wits to a workly thinking through the enlightenment, which is only exacerbated by the age of 'dataism.' Han also discusses that for Kant:

_"In the face of beauty, the cognitive faculties, namely imagination and understanding, are in play mode. The subject likes what is beautiful; the beautiful creates a feeling of pleasure by triggering a harmonious interplay of the cognitive faculties. The beautiful does not buy itself produce knowledge, but it entertains the cognitive mechanisms and, by doing so, promotes the production of knowledge."_ (80)

This is a pretty great section for discussing 'thinking' as a playful activity. I don't know how readily that feeds into contemplation (or if we're getting into sticky territory a la Deweyian reflection) but could be useful and/or at least a fun rabbit-hole to spend some time in.

## Han, B. _Vita Contemplativa_, 2023

_"We are losing a sense for the kind of inactivity that is not an incapability, not a refusal, not just the absence of activity but a capacity in itself."_ (1)

_"'Leisure time' lacks both intensity of life and contemplation. It is a time that we kill so as not to get bored. It is not free, living time; it is dead time."_ (2)

_"We owe true happiness to the useless and purposeless, to what is intentionally convoluted, what is unproductive, indirect, exuberant, superfluous, to beautiful forms and gestures that have no use and serve no purpose."_ (5)

## Fullerton, T. & Farber, M. _The Well-Read Game_, 2025

_"When we play deeply, we take on an aesthetic stance and we are free to explore our own thoughts and feelings about experiences in games."_ (53)

There is a lot here in terms of language and touchpoints. Using Oliveras' deep listening as a foundation for 'deep play' is a good start (Fullerton & Farber point to Lantz's _Beauty of Games_ for that reference). Additionally, beyond F&F's 'well-played' we also have 'anticipatory play' (Upton), 'noninteractive play' (Upton), 'interpretive play' (Upton), and Fullerton's concept of the 'interlude mechanic.' The interlude mechanic in particular might be of interest for the thesis writing, especially in the Playtime section. It helps to cement and/or back the idea of creating breathing/reflective space into the play experience. In general, a more scholarly version of Raven Wu's _[In Praise of Negative Space in Video Game Storytelling](https://intothespine.com/2021/03/27/in-praise-of-negative-space-in-video-game-storytelling/)_ article that I liked so muc. Additionally, I haven't read it yet, but in trying to re-find Wu's article I found amr al-aaser's _[The Art of Nothing: A Look at Negative Space within Videogames](https://siegarettes.medium.com/the-art-of-nothing-a-look-at-negative-space-within-videogames-b92cf950cb73)_ which seems to argues the same thing.

## Kandinsky, W. _Concerning the Spiritual in Art_, 1912

_"emotional states clothed in natural forms (which we might referred to as _Stimmung_: mood, town or pitch"_ (15)

Not a great quote here, but the idea of 'Stimmung' I find interesting. Could possibly use this as a definition/word/concept throughout, but at the very least a good reference to a 'third thing' after representation and impressionism. 

_"An era in which art has no representative at the apex of the triangle, and where there is no transfigured bread from which others can draw nourishment, is a period of decline in the spiritual world ... In such mute and blind times, men attach excessive importance to external success; they care only for material goods and hail a technical advance as a great accomplishment."_ (21)

I see a parallel or reference to the game industry focusing on technical achievement above all else. Good graphics, lifelike audio, fast processor speeds become (or have always been?) more important than a glimpse at the truth of the world. 

_"If this how includes the emotions of the artist's soul, and the artwork is capable of radiating his subtler experience, then art will find itself on the threshold of the path to where that lost 'what' can almost certainly be refound, that 'what' which might form the spiritual bread to feed this nascent spiritual awakening. This 'what' will no longer be the material, objective 'what' of the figurative period we are leaving behind, but rather it will be _artistic substance_, the soul of art, which is essential if its body (the 'how') is to lead a full and healthy life, just as it is for an individual or a population.

This what is that which art alone can perceive, which art alone can articulate, through its modes of expression which belong to art and art alone."_ (23-24)

A bold statement. I don't know if I will feel comfortable using this anywhere in regards to play/games (let alone my own work!), but it is well to be reminded that Kandisnky at least saw the potential of art in the world.

_"This mutual comparison among artistic disciplines will only result in success and triumph if what they learn from one another is not external but based on underlying inner principles. That is to say, one art form must first learn from another how to exploit its resources, and then learn how to apply its own media in a way that is _essentially the same_, but guided by the principle that is _unique_ to each discipline alone. In learning this the artist must not forget that every medium has its own appropriate mode of application which awaits discovery."_ (41)

_"Eventually we come to a point where the distinct strengths of different arts coalesce, until which time we see the emergence of a new art, a synthesized art of which we have experienced but a taste: a truly emphasis monumental art."_ (42)

41 and 40 to do a good job here arguing not only that we can learn from other art forms and apply them to the study at hand (namely games/play), but also 42 in particular points to an argument that games might _be_ that emergent new art that synthesizes all other art forms into a truly monumental art. A bold statement, perhaps, but something that could be used in the study.

## Solnit, R. _Wanderlust_, 2020

_"because thinking is generally thought of as doing nothing in a production-oriented culture, and doing nothing is hard to do. It's best done by disguising it as doing something and the something closest to doing nothing is walking… It is a bodily labor that produces nothing but thoughts, experiences, arrivals."_ (5)

_"I suspect that the mind, like the feet, works at about three miles an hour"_ (10)

Page 10 also has a long discourse on the ways that the march towards efficiency/technology has actually made our free-time worse by leaving no space for "unstructured travel in between." This idea is coming from so many other people as well, but noting here in case I need even more citations to back up the claim.
