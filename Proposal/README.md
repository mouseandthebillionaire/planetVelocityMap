## Methodology

This research relies on game experiments to explore the possibilities in manipulating playful aesthetics towards contemplative ends. These playful experiments will be tangibile outputs to test ideas found in the overlap between playful aesthetics and various contemplative design, with knowledge arising both from the active building of these experiments as well as in conversation with other designers. Each of these prototypes will go through a series of stages. The overall trajectory for this exploration will resemble the classic design process, with stages of divergence and convergence throughout. As in the traditional interactive design process, each stage of the process is evaluated in stasis by me and in conversation with design peers. These conversations will lead to new insights and feed into future iterations of the overall concepts.

Throughout this exploration, I will initially use an internal iterative design process as a basis for which to pursue and evaluate my designs. This is in alignment with ideas stemming from traditional iterative design practice where designers rapidly develop and test many ideas on an individual level, discarding anything that obviously doesn’t work, and refining all of the ideas down to a few testable prototypes. This method also relies on the design through research practices as proposed by Frayling and Redstrom, in which knowledge is gained through the practice of design. 

Additionally, I will gain knowledge about my solution through observation and conversations with other designers. Sharing work with other designers who have deep experience in a discipline is a great way to catch these early mistaken assumptions that I might be making about my audience, goals, and proposed solutions.

(Question 4PB: do I need to have this "intro" and then "in-depth" sections, or should I just wrap it all into a larger narrative on the method?)

### Foundations: Research Through Design, Design Practice, and Practice-Based Research

In his paper for the first issue of Research in Art and Design, Christopher Frayling introduced his ideas for the relationship between research and design. He distinguished between research into art and design (where the research is historical, cultural or theoretical), research through art and design (where the research is into the processes and tools for future design methodologies), and research for art and design (where the end product is an artifact). In the years following, many researchers adapted these ideas, and the area that Frayling labeled as research for art and design has become more widely understood as research through design. 

In their introduction to Perspectives on Design Research, Bærenholdt et al. refer to this mode as both research through design and design-based research (including design through research) noting that, “design becomes as much a medium and process of research, as a result.” It is through the making of designs that knowledge is gained, but how we exactly understand this relationship can be more complex.

The specific framework that I employ to understand how my research and designs are in conversation is firmly situated in Johann Redstrom’s tactic of Sequencing. Redstrom expands on Frayling’s concept of research through design and explores explicit tactics for how these methods are employed. His concept of sequencing, where design and theories are meant to coexist throughout the process, is of particular interest. “Using a highly iterative process, more developed relations between theory and design can evolve as the understanding of how the different design variables will have an impact on the test situation grows deeper.”

I believe that the iterative design process is uniquely suited and positioned to benefit from this concept of sequencing. As a designer, it is fundamental that you document and reflect on your designs and how they are being perceived by a given audience. In this way, you are in constant conversation with the design, testing its validity, and gaining knowledge in the process.

This understanding of the benefits of the design process is echoed in the concepts of practice-based research. Linda Candy, in the Routledge International Handbook of Practice-Based Research, defines practice-based research as “a principled approach to research by means of practice, in which the research and the practice operate as interdependent and complementary processes leading to new and original forms of knowledge.” An important concept here is that it is through the creations of these designed artifacts that the researcher is able to test and gain knowledge about the world.
  
### Internal Iterative Game Design Process and MDM

The initial stages for this research will rely on my practice as a game and sound designer. It is here where the most radical idea generation, design creation, reflection, and refinement will happen.

In The Reflective Practitioner, Donald Schön argues that “research is an activity of practitioners. It is triggered by features of the practice situation, undertaken on the spot, and immediately linked to action.” I have found that this very accurately describes my personal game design process. As a designer, I am in a dialog with my design, and the process involves thousands of microscopic decisions that are repeatedly implemented and evaluated, with this interchange happening throughout the entirety of the process. 

In my own practice, this process starts with a sketching phase. Ideas about visual style, game mechanics, themes, etc are explored by rapidly sketching and reflecting on their feasibility and design potential. The goal of this stage is to generate as many ideas as possible, helping me think through the problem and generate possible solutions. These ideas are then refined down to something more concrete and actionable that I intend to build and test in the digital space. The collateral from these sessions are captured using a camera to be included in any online documentation. 

Once the design process moves into the digital space, I use the game development software Unity, image creation software Photoshop, and digital audio workstations (DAWs) like Reaper and Ableton Live all in conjunction to build prototypes that implement some of the most promising ideas from the earlier phase. As these prototypes are built, new ideas emerge and those that do not work as intended are discarded. This refinement happens repeatedly and at a very quick pace. Then, once the ideas are more solidly understood, the process of refinement introduces even quicker but far less radical incremental changes. This stage adheres to Jesse Schell’s Rule of the Loop, where “the more times you test and improve your design, the better your game will be.”

Through all of these phases, I implement the Method for Design Materialization (MDM) first presented by Rilla Khaled, Jonathan Lessard, and Pippin Barr in “Documenting Trajectories in Design Space: a Methodology for Applied Game Design Research.” In this method, the small decisions that a designer makes during the course of their process are documented using the version control system GitHub.  Any time that the designer uploads a commit, a detailed message is written commenting on the particular design decision, motivations, thoughts, and any future plans at that specific moment in time. This then becomes part of the overall narrative not only of a design’s trajectory, but also the designer’s unique thought process. Khaled et al. state that the “history of commits over time can give an understanding of the overall design space and how it has been traversed: its pressure points, its branching points, where decisions have been made, and where possible lines of inquiry have been pruned.” The most important thing about this is that the large amount of qualitative data produced makes it possible to use methods of analysis derived from grounded theory to organize, analyze, and develop theories about the information that is generated. From this analysis, patterns can emerge to aid in reflection on the solutions and suggest new possible directions for exploration.

### Observation and Designer Conversations

The end goal of the previous stage should be a playable prototype that has made it through several phases of internal testing and refinement and is ready to be shown to others. Generally, the first group of people to see this work are other game and/or sound designers because sharing work with others who are familiar with the intricacies and idiosyncrasies of a given design discipline is a great way to get valuable information and feedback on a design. Experienced practitioners can often more easily see the failings of a design and give more concrete solutions for how those designs can be improved.

The playtests with these designers will be a mix of informal in-person observed playtests and remote playtests where I am not present. For both of these types of playtests, I will ask the participants to give me as detailed feedback as they can, whether verbally or in writing. The purpose of these feedback sessions is to get the unvarnished reactions of the prototypes by those familiar with the field and immediately loop it back into the iterative design process detailed in the previous section. 

One problematic issue that may arise here is that not everyone who is familiar with the field of game design will also be an expert in sound design. They may understand what makes a successful game, but not necessarily how sound is best leveraged in that design. Likewise, it is also true that many who are familiar with sound design may not be as familiar with how that particular discipline is used in games. Additionally, even for those who are experts in both fields, there is often not a common way to discuss and evaluate what we are listening to.

To help facilitate these conversations and to set a common language for the dialogue, I will use the Sound Experience model developed by Ruth Sørensen at IT-University of Copenhagen. In this model, Sørensen introduces a visual aid to help evaluators think about the different modes of listening that happen in any given experience. Listeners are made aware that for any sound there are both external and internal contexts. External contexts include physical ideas such as space and time along with non-physical contexts such as the social and cultural space affecting how the sound may be perceived by the listener. Internal contexts, or those contexts that a listener brings with themselves to the listening experience, are hearing capabilities, historical background, anticipation, and prior experiences. Once this foundational and contextual understanding is established the sound itself can then be addressed and evaluated in four specific areas: emotion, meaning, time, and environment. While not necessarily directly applicable for this particular research, Sørensen also introduces the idea of listening focus, where we can think about where a listener is situated on a spectrum ranging from inattentive to immersed. In general, this model and accompanying visual aid will help to create meaningful discourse with these prototypes to learn more accurately what is and what is not working.

It should be noted that this entire phase of the process will remain under the framework of the MDM. All of the generated feedback will be documented and added to the online GitHub repository. This way it can be included in the overall analysis of the design research. This synthesized information will then be applied to further iterations on both this particular design solution and future explorations.

### Summary

In summary, my methodology for each iteration of this research will go through a series of phases. Firstly through rapid prototyping on an individual level, where my intuition as a designer will help to refine an initially large amount of ideas to only those with the most potential. This design through research practice will facilitate  knowledge creations both about the problem and these possible solutions. Secondly, I will leverage observations and conversations with other designers to test these designs, quickly implementing what is learned into a final playable prototype. Lastly, these prototypes will be shared with the general public, and surveys will be administered to see if the ideas presented create the reflective state that is intended. Throughout all of these phases, I will be using the method for design materialization to document, track, and analyze both my individual designs and the overall process to see what new knowledge can be gained and what new solutions might arise.

## Timetable

In general, I propose to focus on each of the four main aesthetic-topic areas for a set duration. During this focused time, I will read literature and experience first-hand the art and design experiences in this domain, responding to the material both in writing/reflecting and creating playful explorative prototypes. Once the initial explorative stages have been complete, I will spend the remaining time on the synthesis and writing of the thesis paper.

* Space Exploration (3 Months)
* Performance Exploration (3 Months)
* Materiality Exploration (3 Months)
* Time Exploration (3 Months)
* Synthesis and Thesis Writing (6 Months)

## Potential Chapter Breakdown

My initial idea here is to have each of the main chapters focus on an aesthetic of contemplative play. Through each of these lenses, I will look at a specific artistic practice from outside the realm of games and then apply the lessons learned to a designed play experience.

	- Research Summary
	- Methodology
	- Contemplation, Reflection and Art
	
- ==Part 2: Aesthetics in Contemplative Play==<!--Testing the Note plugin to see how it works for comments. Sfine?-->
	- Space
		- Space is a core aesthetic to the play experience. The concept of the magic circle in particular, sets to explain the physical, and mental demarcation between "the real" world and the imaginatively playful world. It is this established structure that gives the player agency to engage in playful acts, choosing one possible action over another and reflecting on how those actions contribute to the imagined world. 
	    - Contemplative Architecture is similar in that the creation and consecration of a space can engender different perspectives than the ones a person came in with. Changes in sound, light, and material imbue the space with a meaning in contrast to the outside world. Huizinga's discussion of the "play-festival-rite" is of particular interest here, as it provides a direct link between play and contemplative (even sacred) spaces.
		- Focusing on this concept of the space in which play happens (i.e the magic circle) and examples from Contemplative Architecture, how can we create playfully contemplative experiences?
	- Physicality and Performance
		  * Much of play is performative. A player acts out scenarios. They move their body in a coordinated effort with other players or the playful system. Play can even be designed so that the act of playing is engaging from those outside of the playspace. Professional sports is a clear example of this, but Let's Plays, E-Sports, and arcade experiences (kids gathered around a Street Fighter cabinet in the 90s or DDR machines in the early aughts) also point to the possibilities of "performing" play.
		- Soundwalking is an excellent genre precedent to think about how not only our physical bodies inhabit an experience, but also how the physical world around us allows for performance. Artists like Hildegard Westerkamp built on the active listening practices of Pauline Oliveras and John Cage to invite listeners to playfully explore acoustic space. Tapping on bridges, shouting in tunnels, banging on cans: these playful acts require the listener to become performer in order to discover something new about the world around them.
		- Thinking about the player as performer and how soundwalks (and other interactive artworks) have used the movement of participants to create meaning, what new contemplative and playful experiences can we create?
	- Materiality
		  	* The materiality of the objects in play has a profound effect on the playful experience. Not only do textures, shapes, and other physical characteristic communicate essential aspects of these items (which Fullerton dubs "resources"), but the very introduction of external elements themselves communicates something about the playful experience. A verbal bang, pointed finger, plastic cap-gun, and hyper-realistic 3D modeled firearm say something of the values at play in the games that include them, but the presence of weaponry at all as a "resource" communicates even more.
		  	* The Performative Objects of Kristina Niedderer fit well into this understanding, as they strategically explore the material and functional aspects of objects in order to provoke what she calls "mindful interactions." Their materiality (often at odds with rather than in service to their functionality) initiates a more reflective stance from the user within the context of their intended use. Yoko Ono's "Play it by Heart" is another clear example of how the materiality of an object can be at service for both play and contemplation.
		  	* "Performative resources" seems then to be a fertile space for exploration (albeit not a great name). Within this understanding, a designer would create material objects for play in which their materiality informs both the playful act and the associated contemplative experience.
	  - Time and Attention
		- In _Das Spiel. Theorien des Spiels_, Hans Scheuerl argues that "play is always a 'playing between'" various characteristics like seriousness and pleasure, rules and chance, focused effort and ease. This concept of 'ambivalence,' in conjunction with Csikszentmihalyi's 'flow' helps to explain the playful state. The oscillation between the states is where play exists. Salen and Zimmerman use the example of the 'play' in a steering wheel.
		- Ambient Media aso relies on ths tension between something that can demand focused attention but also exist entirely in the background. Eno imagined his ambient music as the soundscape to an environment, ever present,  always playing, with the listener able to tune-in or out as they pleased. Games like Oreilly's _Mountain_ are examples of how 'ambient games' might function, in which the player's attention can traverse this ambivalent space at will.
	    - How can the concept of ambient ambivalence be leveraged in regards to time? How can we move the playing of games _away_ from flow-focused and mark the passing of time for contemplative ends? Note: PB's statement of "time is one of the most valuable resources that we ask of our players" is of particular note here.
