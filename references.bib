  abstract = {Within the field of game studies, much ink has been spilt in the quest to define and classify games based on their genre, that is, to determine in which category they belong based on the type of interaction each game affords. Some games lie clearly within an established genre; for example, it is rather difficult to mistake a racing game for a first-person shooter. Other games, however, can fall outside the boundaries of any particular genre, or lie within the perimeters of several genres at once. Such is the case with music games. While some may argue that a game can be considered to be a music game only if its formal elements, such as theme, mechanics or objectives, centre on music, musicians, music making or another music-related activity, in practice the defining characteristics of a music game are much less clear -- or rather, are much broader -- than with other genres. Many game publishers, players, scholars and critics classify a game as musical simply because it features a particular genre of music in its soundtrack or musicians make appearances as playable characters, despite the fact that little-to-no musical activity is taking place within the game.},

Using ample examples, this chapter illustrates the six modes of listening and the virtuoso mode-switching of scientists and other experts.

If a creative artefact is the basis of the contribution to knowledge, the research is practice-based. 2. If the research leads primarily to new understandings about practice, it is practice-led. Practice-based Research is an original investigation undertaken in order to gain new knowledge partly by means of practice and the outcomes of that practice. In a doctoral thesis, claims of originality and contribution to knowledge may be demonstrated through creative outcomes in the form of designs, music, digital media, performances and exhibitions. Whilst the significance and context of the claims are described in words, a full understanding can only be obtained with direct reference to the outcomes. Practice-led Research is concerned with the nature of practice and leads to new knowledge that has operational significance for that practice. In a doctoral thesis, the results of practice-led research may be fully described in text form without the inclusion of a creative work. The primary focus of the research is to advance knowledge about practice, or to advance knowledge within practice. Such research includes practice as an integral part of its method and often falls within the general area of action research.},

The virtual medium provides us with ample opportunities to behave and act out with relative freedom and impunity. Or does it? Sound Play explores the aesthetic, ethical, and sociopolitical stakes of our engagements with gaming's audio phenomena---from sonic violence to synthesized operas, from democratic musical performances to verbal sexual harassment. Cheng shows how the simulated environments of games empower designers, composers, players, and scholars to test and tinker with music, noise, speech, and silence in ways that might not be prudent or possible in the real world. In negotiating utopian and alarmist stereotypes of video games, Sound Play synthesizes insights from across musicology, sociology, anthropology, communications, literary theory, and philosophy. With case studies that span Final Fantasy VI, Silent Hill, Fallout 3, The Lord of the Rings Online, and Team Fortress 2, this book insists that what we do in there---in the safe, sound spaces of games---can ultimately teach us a great deal about who we are and what we value (musically, culturally, humanly) out here.},

We first argue that this new area has been largely omitted from the contemporary research agenda in neuroaesthetics and thus remains a domain of untapped potential. We seek to define this domain to foster a clear and focused investigation of the capacity of the arts and architecture to induce phenomenological states of a contemplative kind. By proposing a sensorimotor account of the experience of architecture, we operationalize how being attuned to architecture can lead to contemplative states. In contrasting the externally-induced methods with internally-induced methods for eliciting a contemplative state of mind, we argue that architecture may spontaneously and effortlessly lead to such states as certain built features naturally resonate with our sensorimotor system. We suggest that becoming sensible of the resonance and attunement process between internal and external states is what creates an occasion for an externally-induced contemplative state. Finally, we review neuroscientific studies of architecture, elaborate on the brain regions involved in such aesthetic contemplative responses, provide architectural examples, and point at the contributions that this new area of inquiry may have in fields such as the evidence-based design movement in architecture.

Based on cases lasting from nine to thirteen months we address specific benefits and challenges that we have encountered while employing the tool.

Benefits include support of shared reflection and discussion in on-going projects, the development, refining, and reflection upon research questions, scaffolding longitudinal and cross-project studies. Moreover, the benefits derived from entering design materials and other kinds of artefacts into a tool may not be achieved until must later, for instance when writing research publications.},

  abstract = {A play-centered invitation to experience the power and delight unlocked by imagination.Bernard De Koven (1941--2018) was a pioneering designer of games and theorist of fun. He studied games long before the field of game studies existed. For De Koven, games could not be reduced to artifacts and rules; they were about a sense of transcendent fun. This book, his last, is about the imagination: the imagination as a playground, a possibility space, and a gateway to wonder. The Infinite Playground extends a play-centered invitation to experience the power and delight unlocked by imagination. It offers a curriculum for playful learning.De Koven guides the readers through a series of observations and techniques, interspersed with games. He begins with the fundamentals of play, and proceeds through the private imagination, the shared imagination, and imagining the world---observing, ``the things we imagine can become the world.'' Along the way, he reminisces about playing ping-pong with basketball great Bill Russell; begins the instructions for a game called Reception Line with ``Mill around''; and introduces blathering games---Blather, Group Blather, Singing Blather, and The Blather Chorale---that allow the player's consciousness to meander freely.Delivered during the last months of his life, The Infinite Playground has been painstakingly cowritten with Holly Gramazio, who worked together with coeditors Celia Pearce and Eric Zimmerman to complete the project as Bernie De Koven's illness made it impossible for him to continue writing. Other prominent game scholars and designers influenced by De Koven, including Katie Salen Tekinba{\c s}, Jesper Juul, Frank Lantz, and members of Bernie's own family, contribute short interstitial essays.ContributorsIan Bogost, Stephen Conway, Adriaan de Jongh, Elyon De Koven, Rocky De Koven, Mary Flanagan, Gonzalo Frasca, Tracy Fullerton, Holly Gramazio, Catherine Herdlick, Jesper Juul, Frank Lantz, Colleen Macklin, Celia Pearce, Sebastian Quack, Lee Rush, Katie Salen Tekinba{\c s}, John Sharp, Tassos Stevens, Akira Thompson, Greg Trefry, Douglas Wilson, Zach Wood, Eric Zimmerman},

  abstract = {This research started in 2004 as a search for a pervasive game equivalent of Brian Eno's ignorable ambient music, such as `Music for Airports'. Brian Eno explicitly stated that the attention of listeners might alter over time, from ignoring to listening intently to the music; the ambient music pervading an environment and creating a mood, "it must be as ignorable as it is interesting" (Eno, 1978) Listeners might come across the music and then choose to what extent they engage with it. Defining ambience, and ambient properties, was particularly challenging. The concept of ambience, especially when applied to games, was not immediately clear. Building on the definition of ambience developed by Brian Eno for music (ibid.), fundamental properties of ambience as applied to games were posited. These properties included ideas of different levels of engagement by players, different levels of affect, persistence of the game when players are not present and the context of the game (where, when, who). The game design research methodology (Dishman, 2003; Eglin, Eyles, \& Dansey, 2008; Eyles, 2008b; Zimmerman, 2003) developed for this research was used with phenomenological methods (Krzywinska, 2005; Mallon, 2006) to determine the experience of players and hence throw light on the fundamental nature of games and ambient gameplay. Following research into experimental games (M. Eyles, Eglin, R., 2007a, 2007b) which were designed to contain high degrees of ambience as previously (theoretically) defined it became clear that many existing commercial games contain some ambient (sometimes emergent) properties. They are not designed to be played ambiently, but have properties that facilitate ambient play (see ambient properties above). The research with experimental ambient games enabled the development of a phenomenologically predicated ambient lens through which these existing games could be viewed. This lens was then further refined by considering the ambience of both the experimental and the commercial games; finally arriving at a description of key features of ambient play. Constant comparisons within and between different data, and back to definitions of musical ambience, were used to ensure rigor (Glaser, 1978). This paper focuses on the findings of this research into ambience in games, delivering a succinct and far reaching schema of ambience that has not only been applied to existing games but has some important implications for the design of future games, throwing new light on the experience of game players and in particular of the inventive, collaborative and ambiguous nature of game playing. The applications of this research are wide reaching, in particular due to the `gamification' (Campbell, 2011; McGonigal, 2011; Schell, 2010) of many products and services. For example, the awarding of points and rewards for use of online shops (such as Ebay) and the vine growing display of the Ford Fusion Hybrid car to denote driving efficiency (hypermilling) (Squatriglia, 2009). These applications of game mechanisms are pervasive, having many similarities to the ambient gameplay investigated in this research. The findings of this research into ambient play within games clearly indicate elements and approaches that could enhance the experience of gamified products and applications. Further this research offers a new way of looking at games, including both pervasive and commercial video games.},

  abstract = {An original exploration of the role of aesthetics in contemporary design, uniquely combining philosophical aesthetics and cultural analysis of design.As a product of human ingenuity, design functions as an artificial interface through which we meet the world. While the ubiquity of design seems to render it imperceptible, when we truly reflect on design, we see that it is inextricably entwined with our experience of the world. In Design Aesthetics, Mads Nygaard Folkmann provides an engaging introduction to the field of design aesthetics and its role as a concept. Engaging with sensual, conceptual, and contextual considerations of design aesthetics, this book investigates design experience in tandem with design practice, objects, and perception. Part one of Design Aesthetics lays the theoretical foundation by differentiating between sensual, conceptual, and contextual dimensions of design aesthetics and clarifying what ``aesthetic experience'' means in relation to design. The second part of the book consists of studies in implications of design aesthetics for design practice, design objects with embedded technology, and the construction of perception of aesthetic qualities in objects. In its focus on design aesthetics, the book is intended for everyone working with design---design students, designer researchers, and designers---as well as students and researchers in aesthetics in general.},

In the TiM project (Tactile Interactive Mul-timedia), SITREC develops three sound-based games that point out new directions for game audio design. The TiM games demonstrate different ways in which games can be designed around an auditory experience. Several unique fea-tures of audio games are presented emphasising unexplored potentials for interactivity and future development areas are suggested. SITREC proposes an approach to the design of auditory interfaces that takes three listening modes into considera-tion: casual listening, semantic listening and reduced lis-tening. A semiotic model is presented that illustrates this view on sound object design and ways in which sounds can be combined. The discourse focuses on issues of continuous display, musicality and clarity, and introduces the notion of ''spatialised game soundtracks, '' as opposed to separated background music and game effect sounds. The main challenge when developing auditory interfaces is to balance functionality and aesthetics. Other important issues are the inclusion of meta-level information in order to achieve a high level of complexity and to provide elements of open-endedness. This refers to planning the overall game-play, as well as to designing individual sound objects and combining them into complex, interactive soundscapes.},

Video games demand that we listen past this implicit assumption and come to understand how the ``digital'' and ``natural'' converge in productive ways to reframe and extend public discourse surrounding the environment. Stardew Valley and other environmental games take places seriously in their rendering of environments, but also in their detailed weather conditions and the interactions among human and nonhuman-organic and inorganic actors.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Through the critical, iterative making of a series of game design experiments, in this practice-based research I enact and interrogate a collection of strategies and terms for the design, making, study, and discussion of reflective, shortform videogames. These are videogames, generally produced by individuals or small teams of makers, that are designed to be experienced in a single sitting, and encourage players to thoughtfully consider, reflect upon, anticipate, and configure the audiovisual, narrative, and/or ludic elements juxtaposed within the game's digital-virtual space. Historically, there have been a series of shortform game designs that are invested in offering the player an intense, reaction-based challenge. Recently however, a variety of non-commercial game designers have been experimenting with and producing shortform videogames that instead seek to elicit reflective forms of play. These designers, including myself, have been spurred on by the increasing accessibility and availability of game development tools and online distribution platforms. Much formal and informal game design knowledge fails to account for this emerging form, and instead assumes either a long form, or a design goal of immediate, reaction-based play within a short form.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Seeking to address this gap in knowledge, in this research I offer game designers four key strategies for the design of reflective play within a shortform game design. They include limiting, omitting, and making ambiguous traditional elements of game design such as objectives and win/lose conditions, and avoiding any interruptions or excessive direction to the player's experience of the game. Crucially, I suggest that it is useful to pair this with strictly limited, clear and consistent spatiotemporal barriers and boundaries. This reduces the scope of the game design to a single spatial cell that is experienced near-simultaneously. I uncover, articulate, and demonstrate these strategies through the design and making of ten game design experiments. This is an exploratory process supported by critical reflection, reading and writing. Each game investigates some aspect of reflective and/or brief game design, and together they reveal a set of subjective, situated tactics for encouraging reflective play within a shortform videogame.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {``Navigable narratives'' are a subgenre of narrative-based video games under the umbrella definition of ``walking simulators.'' While they are a subgenre of video games, analyzing their score or soundscape purely through a video game lens paints an incomplete picture because of their different artistic focus. Models like Elizabeth Medina-Gray's modular analysis are a useful start but insufficient on their own to understand this genre's sound. Rather, a participant's experience in a navigable narrative is often quite similar to that of a soundwalk, especially a virtual reality soundwalk; the game composer/audio designer creates an intricate soundscape through which the participant moves, and with the main focus on the story and gradual travel, the participant has more time and capacity than in a typical video game to build meaning from the soundwalk they perform. One of the major relationships navigable narratives have with soundwalks is the breakdown of diegesis in the soundscape the participant takes in, which is unlike most video games. To analyze the soundwalk and also the soundscape present in navigable narratives, I draw from R. Murray Schafer, Hildegard Westerkamp, and Janet Cardiff. In the opposite direction, in many ways navigable narratives are very much like ``literary computer games,'' or interactive narratives that may be analyzed via ``ludostylistics'' {\`a} la Janet Murray and Astrid Ensslin. A key element in many navigable narratives is the use of narrative time, as described by Alicyn Warren, rather than real time, which also sets navigable narratives apart from standard video games and especially from soundwalks. To explore these varied models and lenses, I demonstrate an analytical approach, using Leaving Lyndow (2017) as my primary case study. And so, between these analytical lenses of video game music theory, soundscape and soundwalk study, and ludostylistics applicable to literary computer games, I posit that the sound of navigable narratives is best understood through a synthesis of all three.},

Multivalent in nature, game time is characterized by apparent malleability, navigability, and possibility while simultaneously being highly restrictive and requiring replay and repetition. Hanson demonstrates that compared to analog tabletop games, sports, film, television, and other forms of media, the temporal structures of digital games provide unique opportunities to engage players with liveness, causality, potentiality, and lived experience that create new ways of experiencing time.

  abstract = {An analysis of wandering within different game worlds, viewed through the lenses of work, colonialism, gender, and death. Wandering in games can be a theme, a formal mode, an aesthetic metaphor, or a player action. It can mean walking, escaping, traversing, meandering, or returning. In this book, game studies scholar Melissa Kagen introduces the concept of ``wandering games,'' exploring the uses of wandering in a variety of game worlds. She shows how the much-derided Walking Simulator---a term that began as an insult, a denigration of games that are less violent, less task-oriented, or less difficult to complete---semi-accidentally tapped into something brilliant: the vast heritage and intellectual history of the concept of walking in fiction, philosophy, pilgrimage, performance, and protest. Kagen examines wandering in a series of games that vary widely in terms of genre, mechanics, themes, player base, studio size, and funding, giving close readings to Return of the Obra Dinn, Eastshade, Ritual of the Moon, 80 Days, Heaven's Vault, Death Stranding, and The Last of Us Part II. Exploring the connotations of wandering within these different game worlds, she considers how ideologies of work, gender, colonialism, and death inflect the ways we wander through digital spaces. Overlapping and intersecting, each provides a multifaceted lens through which to understand what wandering does, lacks, implies, and offers. Kagen's account will attune game designers, players, and scholars to the myriad possibilities of the wandering ludic body.},

In this paper, we outline such an approach. We focus on the question of an appropriate method for an academic game design research practice that is grounded in making and play while respecting recoverability and context. We demonstrate what game analysis based on such a method can reveal, drawing on the case of Pippin Barr's It is as if you were doing work, and show how method and analysis in tandem can materialise tacit design knowledge, support balanced subjectivity, and illuminate the often abstract design problem space.},

For decades, it has been acknowledged as an important process in learning, and in recent years it has become a central focus of branches of interaction design. Games are highly appropriate vehicles for triggering and supporting reflection, but several of the dominant tropes of conventional game design directly work against reflection. In serious games, the promise of safe environments, the drive to pose problems with clear solutions and a preference for stealth learning complicate how directly we can design for reflection. In mainstream entertainment games, qualities such as immersion and the design traditions of designing for the everyplayer and quantifying motivation again run counter to a reflective agenda. Drawing on the critical and reflective design literature and on case studies of experimental games on the peripheries of mainstream game design, I propose reflective game design, a new alternative design agenda from which to design, deconstruct and make sense of play experiences.},

  abstract = {This dissertation is positioned on the multidiscipline of game studies. It presents the findings of a ten-year study of game developers and the contexts of their creative practices. As a multidisciplinary enquiry, this study draws from the theoretical and methodological traditions of creativity studies, management studies, computer science, and design research to supplement the young discipline of game studies. However, studying game developers is not a typical focus for the field of academic game research. The dissertation critically comments on the tradition of game studies for its ontological narrowness and the neglect of the relevance of the creator in the quest for understanding the phenomenon of games and play.    Altogether, this work draws from nineteen sub-studies to explore game development as experienced, highlighting issues that frame creation practices. The study is exploratory utilising multiple methods capturing the voices and realities of the creators. The overview of the study is ethnographically informed: the data collection covers an extensive period in games from 2006 to 2016, bridging the sub-studies with field work and digital ethnography at multiple industry events around the globe and social media platforms.     The findings are distilled into five claims: 1) Game design is timely and particular, 2) Game design is value pluralistic, 3) Game design process is opportunistic, 4) Game design process is a plethora of ideas, and 5) Game design practice is natured and nurtured by the surrounding ecosystem. These theses form the grounding of game design praxiology, which in this work is defined as a pursuit of studying games as created.    This dissertation takes several levels of game developers' realities and experiences into consideration. Firstly, it addresses the changing environment and recent trends in the game industry painting a picture of a challenging field of action. Such an environment requires flexibility and adaptation from the creators making game development a constant learning process. One of the highlighted trends is the casual turn in games. This normalisation of digital play has had a wide impact on the ways games are created.    Secondly, this work explores the multitude of game design, and discusses how games can be many and always affected by the values and appreciations of their respective creators. The notion of game design value is utilised in communicating the pluralistic nature of game design. Game design cannot be reduced to a single value, even though making a single game can be dominated by one.    Thirdly, the dissertation addresses the iterative nature of game development. Iteration as a core concept within game development is elaborated in this work into a larger notion of opportunism in design work. Opportunistic attitudes are visible on multiple levels of game work, and embraced as well as amplified within game creation cultures. Game developers do not only need to react to the changes within the industry, but take the opportunities that might come about within the development processes.    A big part of the study is revolving around the notion of a game idea. The level of ideas is more accessible to the outsiders of the creation cultures, but often misunderstood. The creative process of making games is collaborative and social, requiring creative input from several professions. The game innovation processes are not solely based on single overarching game ideas, but rather on various idea acts. This forms the fourth focus point for the dissertation.     Lastly, the work highlights how the larger ecosystem impacts on the game development practices. For the past decade, the game industry has expanded into a wide ecosystem of diverse actors and professions. This varying network of actors, including non-commercial actors, has its own role in nurturing the developments of the field. As one example, the phenomenon of the game jams is highlighted exposing a widely spread movement of creative communities emphasising diversity, co-creativity, opportunism, and prototyping cultures impacting a whole generation of game developers. The work calls for further research within game design praxiology: as long as game making is not a part of the basic education in the same way as writing or drawing, games are in danger of remaining misunderstood as a wide and vibrant form of art and practise.

V{\"a}it{\"o}skirja ammentaa kymmenvuotisesta tutkimusperiodista muun muassa luovuustutkimuksen, johtamistutkimuksen, tietojenk{\"a}sittelytieteiden ja suunnittelututkimuksen teoreettisia ja metodologisia perinteit{\"a} yhdist{\"a}en. V{\"a}it{\"o}skirjan tarkastelun kohteena ovat pelinkehitt{\"a}jien luovat prosessit ja se konteksti, jossa pelit syntyv{\"a}t.    Kaikkiaan ty{\"o} koostuu yhdeks{\"a}st{\"a}toista osatutkimuksesta, jotka kukin avaavat pelintekemist{\"a} eri n{\"a}k{\"o}kulmista. Tutkimus on eksploratiivinen ja hy{\"o}dynt{\"a}{\"a} useita metodeja korostaen tekij{\"o}iden n{\"a}k{\"o}kulmaa ja kokemuksia. Tutkimuksen ote on my{\"o}s etnografinen: aineiston ker{\"a}ys kattaa mittavan aikajakson pelialan kehityksess{\"a} vuodesta 2006 vuoteen 2016 silloittaen osatutkimuksia Suomeen ja ulkomaille kohdistuneilla kentt{\"a}jaksoilla sek{\"a} digitaalisen etnografian keinoin.     Tulokset tiivistyv{\"a}t viiteen v{\"a}itteeseen: 1) pelisuunnittelu on aika- ja teossidonnaista, 2) pelisuunnittelu on moniarvoista, 3) pelisuunnittelun prosessit ovat opportunistisia, 4) pelisuunnitteluprosesseja m{\"a}{\"a}ritt{\"a}{\"a} ideoiden runsaus ja 5) pelisuunnittelun k{\"a}yt{\"a}nt{\"o}j{\"a} ohjaa sit{\"a} ymp{\"a}r{\"o}iv{\"a} ekosysteemi. N{\"a}m{\"a} teesit muodostavat perustan pelisuunnittelun praxiologialle, joka t{\"a}ss{\"a} ty{\"o}ss{\"a} m{\"a}{\"a}ritell{\"a}{\"a}n pyrkimykseksi tutkia pelej{\"a} tehtyin{\"a}.    T{\"a}m{\"a} v{\"a}it{\"o}sty{\"o} ottaa huomioon pelintekij{\"o}iden ty{\"o}n reunaehtoja ja kokemuksia useilla tasoilla. Yht{\"a}{\"a}lt{\"a} v{\"a}it{\"o}s k{\"a}sittelee haasteelista pelintekij{\"o}iden toimintakentt{\"a}{\"a} ja peliteollisuuden muuttuvaa ymp{\"a}rist{\"o}{\"a}. Jatkuvat muutokset vaativat tekij{\"o}ilt{\"a} joustavuutta ja mukautumista, sek{\"a} tekev{\"a}t pelinkehitt{\"a}misest{\"a} jatkuvan oppimisprosessin. Yksi keskeisist{\"a} muutoksista tutkimuksen tarkastelujaksolla on pelialan ns. kasuaalik{\"a}{\"a}nne (eng. casual turn). T{\"a}t{\"a} k{\"a}{\"a}nnett{\"a} voidaan luonnehtia digitaalisen pelaamisen normalisoitumiseksi ja sill{\"a} on ollut laaja vaikutus siihen, miten pelej{\"a} luodaan.    Toiseksi v{\"a}it{\"o}sty{\"o} kartoittaa pelien moninaisuutta ja k{\"a}sittelee sit{\"a}, kuinka pelit taipuvat moneen tekij{\"o}idens{\"a} arvojen ja mieltymysten ohjaamina. Tutkimus hy{\"o}dynt{\"a}{\"a} suunnitteluarvon k{\"a}sitett{\"a} rakentaessaan ymm{\"a}rryst{\"a} pelisuunnittelun pluralistisesta luonteesta. Teoreettisessa mieless{\"a} pelisuunnittelua ei voida palauttaa yksiarvoisuuteen, vaikkakin yht{\"a} pelintekemisen prosessia voi hallita jokin yksitt{\"a}inen arvo tai arvomaailma.    Kolmanneksi v{\"a}it{\"o}skirja k{\"a}sittelee pelinkehityksen iteratiivista luonnetta. Iteraatio pelinkehityksen ydinkonseptina muotoutuu t{\"a}ss{\"a} v{\"a}it{\"o}sty{\"o}ss{\"a} laajemmaksi opportunistisen suunnittelun kehykseksi. Opportunistiset asenteet ovat n{\"a}ht{\"a}viss{\"a} pelintekemisen eri tasoilla. Pelinkehitt{\"a}jien t{\"a}ytyy paitsi reagoida muutoksiin, my{\"o}s tarttua tilaisuuksiin, jotka saattavat synty{\"a} tuotantoprosessien aikana ja niiden v{\"a}leiss{\"a} liittyen peliprojektin yksityiskohtiin tai laajempiin pelialan kehityskaariin.     Iso osa tutkimuksesta rakentuu peli-idean k{\"a}sitteen ymp{\"a}rille. Pelialan ulkopuoliselle ideointi n{\"a}ytt{\"a}ytyy usein helposti l{\"a}hestytt{\"a}v{\"a}lt{\"a} osa-alueelta. Ideointiin ja ideoiden rooliin liittyy kuitenkin paljon harhak{\"a}sityksi{\"a}. Pelintekemisen luova prosessi perustuu yhteisty{\"o}h{\"o}n javaatii panoksia, sek{\"a} usein kompromissej{\"a}, usealta ammattiryhm{\"a}lt{\"a}. Pelien innovaatioprosessit eiv{\"a}t pohjaudu yhteen ideaan, vaan pikemminkin monenlaisiin ideak{\"a}yt{\"a}nt{\"o}ihin. T{\"a}st{\"a} muodostuu v{\"a}it{\"o}skirjan nelj{\"a}s tarkastelun kohde.    Viimeiseksi ty{\"o} nostaa esiin, kuinka ymp{\"a}r{\"o}iv{\"a} pelialan ekosysteemi vaikuttaa pelinkehityksen k{\"a}yt{\"a}nt{\"o}ihin. Viimeisen vuosikymmenen ajan peliteollisuuden ekosysteemi on laajentunut ja alalla vaikuttaa nyky{\"a}{\"a}n useita toimijoita eri ammattinimikkeiden alla. T{\"a}ll{\"a} toimijoiden moninaisella verkostolla, johon kuuluvat my{\"o}s ei-kaupalliset toimijat, on oma rooli alan kehittymisess{\"a}. Yhten{\"a} ilmi{\"o}-esimerkkin{\"a} esiin nostetaan pelijamit. Pelijamien laajalle levinnyt toimintakulttuuri korostaa monimuotoisuutta, yhdess{\"a} luomista, opportunistista suunnittelua ja oppimista sek{\"a} prototypointikeskeist{\"a} pelinkehityst{\"a}. T{\"a}m{\"a} toimintakulttuuri vaikuttaa kokonaiseen pelinkehitt{\"a}jien sukupolveen. V{\"a}it{\"o}sty{\"o} per{\"a}{\"a}nkuuluttaa pelisuunnittelun praxiologian jatkotutkimusta. Niin kauan kuin pelintekeminen ei ole osana peruskoulutusta, kuten esimerkiksi kirjoittaminen ja kuvallinen ilmaisu, peli-ilmi{\"o}iden ymm{\"a}rt{\"a}minen on vaarassa j{\"a}{\"a}d{\"a} ohueksi. V{\"a}it{\"o}s auttaa ymm{\"a}rt{\"a}m{\"a}{\"a}n pelintekemist{\"a} ihmiskeskeisen{\"a}, elinvoimaisena ja monimuotoisena luovana toimintana.},

Although numerous systems have been developed in both academic and industrial contexts, currently there is no unified method for producing this type of content -- not even an agreement on input variables, output variations or assessment criteria. Our research aims to create an audio system for video games that improves the experience by adapting environmental music to emotions associated with the ongoing narrative. This system combines short audio tracks of pre-designed music in real time, using player behavior and emerging feelings as main cues. In this paper, we identify some of the issues that dynamic music faces through the study of current adaptive and procedural techniques, and describe how our sound system architecture attempts to solve them. In the end, we claim that a sonification method like the proposed one could improve player engagement by adapting music to each game situation, driven by a solid focus on emotional storytelling.},

We divide these elements into five approaches: Disruptions, Slowdowns, Questioning, Revisiting, and Enhancers. Finally, we provide an actionable supplement for practicing game developers to apply these concepts to their games.},

This unstructured exploration is accompanied by a procedurally generated ambient soundtrack that incorporates both harmonic textures and melodic motives, and abstract musical representations of environmental sounds. In the absence of clearly defined goals---except to progress through four distinct ``seasons'' of the game---the player's relationship to the soundtrack becomes a core gameplay element, and a playthrough of Proteus becomes, among other things, a kind of improvised performance art.Viewed from this perspective, Proteus's combination of free exploration and chance strongly evokes ideas from mid-twentieth-century musical modernism, including the graphic scores of Cardew and Cage and the ``mobile form'' works of Stockhausen and Ligeti. Proteus further complicates analysis by concealing the mechanisms that produce particular musical fragments and by eliding the roles of listener and player/performer. This article examines the tensions inherent in the complementary actions of playing/performing Proteus and listening to/analyzing it, and argues that the game challenges the distinctions between creator, performer, and observer by vividly embodying the most deeply ingrained metaphors of music analysis.},

  abstract = {A new approach to theory development for practice-driven research, proposing that theory is something made in and through design.Tendencies toward ``academization'' of traditionally practice-based fields have forced design to articulate itself as an academic discipline, in theoretical terms. In this book, Johan Redstr{\"o}m offers a new approach to theory development in design research--one that is driven by practice, experimentation, and making. Redstr{\"o}m does not theorize from the outside, but explores the idea that, just as design research engages in the making of many different kinds of things, theory might well be one of those things it is making.Redstr{\"o}m proposes that we consider theory not as stable and constant but as something unfolding---something acted as much as articulated, inherently fluid and transitional. Redstr{\"o}m describes three ways in which theory, in particular formulating basic definitions, is made through design: the use of combinations of fluid terms to articulate issues; the definition of more complex concepts through practice; and combining sets of definitions made through design into ``programs.'' These are the building blocks for creating conceptual structures to support design. Design seems to thrive on the complexities arising from dichotomies: form and function, freedom and method, art and science. With his idea of transitional theory, Redstr{\"o}m departs from the traditional academic imperative to pick a side---theory or practice, art or science. Doing so, he opens up something like a design space for theory development within design research.},

The artifacts thus designed and used every day affect the quality of life and the state of the world through their aesthetic dimensions. By broadening the scope of aesthetic discourse, the book examines the content and ramifications of our aesthetic response to things and the environment with which we interact on a daily basis. The approach is more exploratory than argumentative, and the discussion is illustrated by examples from nature, designed objects, built environments, and Japanese aesthetics.},

  abstract = {Although the connection of making and knowledge may seem self-evident for a designer, we experienced in developing an educational design research course at Media, Arts \& Design Faculty (Genk, Belgium), that when design and research are intertwined, students tend to lose their focus on making. Therefore, this paper explores how the intertwining of making and reflecting can be more explicitly supported throughout the process. We propose to use playful design representations throughout the design process to mediate this interaction between making and reflecting. Elaborating on Buckland (1991), Visser (2011), Suchman (1995) and Palmer (1978), we describe design representations as representations, descriptions, interpretations of (elements of) a design, e.g. field studies, experiments, prototypes. They are made by designers throughout the making process, and used within collaborative settings to enable communication among participants via confronting their reflections in making. We argue that making design representations stimulates iterations and immersion, and in combination with rules of play, reflection and making are even better intertwined. This paper documents the findings and conclusions, which we have drawn from empirical use in our student course, and give an overview of literature on the current uses of design representations and their attempts to combine making and reflecting.},

Although the first version of Spacewar! (1962) had no means of generating sound, audio capabilities were developed and added shortly after its first release. It could even be argued that the experience of sound in the first generation of video and tele-games sparked the subsequent development of sonifying GUIs (Graphical User Interface) if one considers that, for example, Steve Wozniak ported Breakout for the Apple II in 1977 and specifically added a speaker with 1 bit of sound. At present, it would be hard not to agree that video and computer games have to be regarded as audiovisual media systems par excellence.},

  abstract = {In 2019, the International Organization for Standardization published a specification for soundscape research, ISO 12913. Revisiting the World Soundscape Project?s conceptual constructs of soundscape formulated in the 1970s, and drawing on research methods across the humanities, science, and the arts, the specification is now commonly referred to as the ?soundscape approach?. The aim of ISO 12913 is to investigate the sonic environment in terms of how it is perceived by a local community, and present findings that can inform soundscape interventions (design, policy, planning, etc.) to ultimately improve quality of life in the built environment. Deployment of the soundscape approach to research in the built environment presents new professional opportunities for sound designers, such as collaboration with architects, ecologists, and other professionals, and extension of practice into soundscape design. Through participation in public-facing research events such as soundwalks, the soundscape approach is an ideal context for sound designers to raise awareness of the aesthetics of soundscape, its value as a natural resource, and a context for creative practice. New insights from published studies where the soundscape approach is implemented can inform studio-based cinematic sound design, deepening understanding of soundscape perception to the benefit to screen-based and virtual reality projects.},
