## 03.26.25 State of the State

Big breath.

Interesting to have a lot of this documented in the [Conversations](Conversations.md) document with nothing here yet. Though as per the GaR discussion of [hierarchies of practice](https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISTS/process/journal.html#hierarchies-of-design-practice) there is something to be said for separating out these various modalities. [On the other hand](https://youtu.be/TcnBfSuqfAw?si=bHutCFGEo56JKiGr&t=97) there is also something nice about having all of the thoughts laid down in front of you chronologically. Something to be reflecting on as I work through this, especially when we start separating out the "thesis writing" work from "designing playful experience" work. For now, I will keep this space for reflective, big-picture, weekly entries about the overall process, with a goal for posting something here every Wednesday before the weekly meeting on Friday.

On the structural side (and in response to the [Etherpad suggestion](Conversations.md##-PB:-2025.03.24-(Email))) I am currently experimenting with getting an instance of that running on my server and seeing what kind of version control we have access to. I am also experimenting with various plugins in Obsidian (since I had been writing there anyway) to see about tracking comments there.

On the writing side, fleshed out the chapter breakdowns to start laying out the language (and thinking) behind what each of these is trying to say/be/do. None of them are quite there, but it's a good exercise to getting words out there and see what sticks[^1].

## Notes: 
[^1]:Already the section on "Time" feels less defensible as being tied to Ambient Media, but it's also probable that I'm just too tired to give it the attention it deserves. Don't abandon it yet!
