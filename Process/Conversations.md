# A Conversation between MB and PB

## PB: 2025.02.26

Trying this some more. Though it feels weird knowing that it can't be part of the "true" repo in the sense of the thing managed by Git. The other option (which I'm actually trying a bit for this exhibition project for AMAZE this year with Csongor Baranyai [here](https://github.com/csongorb/growingstuff/blob/main/process/dialogue.md).

To which end, do we want to have some kind of dialogue.md or similar in the thesis repo where we can have slower-but-documented exchanges?

Differently, I'm revisiting Chogue with Jonathan at the moment for a book chapter and for that we mostly discussed stuff via email (pre-Discord!!) and I then pasted it into a document that went into the repo: https://github.com/pippinbarr/chogue/wiki/Correspondence)

Actually that was via a Wiki and you can, I think, work with that wiki as a (separate) repo, so that's another potential option to documenting the process elements of the proposal/thesis writing I guesssssss. Or literally write the thesis in the wiki and then the main repo is just there to hold an series of PDFs as "releases" of the thesis, hehe.

Hmmm ANYWAY all of this is precursor to:

I guess the next obvious step is to take this proposed chapter breakdown and add one or two sentences to each beat trying to characterize one layer deeper?

Moving your comments from the [original issues location](https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/planetVelocityMap/issues/2) and pasting here in full. This is getting meta and I like it. I agree that this format seems more suited to the MDMing of the thesis? And since the conversation should be a ping-pong type occurence, feels pretty easy to add you as a contributor to the repo so that you can post directly in the file? Doesn't do the direct line by line referencing that a google doc would (nor allow you to proactively clean up my otherwise messy prose), but I think the benefits outweigh this.

So onto the task at hand:

Yes, I will work on fleshing out the chapter breakdowns and go more in-depth about what will be happening in each of those sections. It's going to be fun to think about.

Yeah it may suffice? At least for early days it's not really about line-level commentary anyway, and quoting would probably work fine for a bunch of stuff. We shall see if it gets unweildy. I am only writing this to prove I can sync commit and push to this repo. I can.
